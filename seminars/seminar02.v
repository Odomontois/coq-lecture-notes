(**
Explanation: the proof of the last branch of the step-by-step proof
is trivial, so it can be handled with [//].
This leaves us with just the first subgoal.
[move=> a_na. move=> a.] can be merged into [move=> a_na a.]
which itself can be melded into the preceeding [split] tactic.

The [tac1; tac2] construction allows us to apply [tac2] tactic
to all the subgoals we are left with after applying [tac1] tactic.
